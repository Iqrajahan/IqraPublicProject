Objective: 
This project is meant for a person to quickly generate vcards for their own name card.
it can be easily modified to include more parameters, or run in other methods, eg. referencing a csv file with multiple people, to generate multiple qr at a time.


The project is using a library from davidshimjs to generate the QR code. 
https://github.com/davidshimjs/qrcodejs/blob/master/README.md


note: Care should be taken when crafting the vcard syntax. it is very sensitive and requires proper syntax to function correctly.
